# etf  
etf is a module for encoding/decoding of the [Erlang External Term Format](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html) in Python.

## About  
I wrote this to learn the intimate details of the spec.  
There are more mature libraries out there already for ETF encoding/decoding. See: [erlport](https://github.com/hdima/erlport) and [erlastic](https://github.com/samuel/python-erlastic).

### Status  
This module is still currently under development.

### Future Plans  
I would eventually like to make this a *streaming* codec via coroutines.
