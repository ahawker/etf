# etf  
etf is codec module for supporting [Erlang External Term Format](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html) in Python.

## About  
Even though there are already other libraries which support this functionality see:
[erlport](https://github.com/hdima/erlport) and [python-erlastic](https://github.com/samuel/python-erlastic),
I am reinventing the wheel for the purposes of learning the intimate details of the spec.
