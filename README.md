# etf  
etf is codec module for supporting [http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html](Erlang External Term Format) in Python.

## About  
Even though there are already other libraries which support this functionality see:
[https://github.com/hdima/erlport](erlport) and [https://github.com/samuel/python-erlastic](python-erlastic),
I am reinventing the wheel for the purposes of learning the intimate details of the spec.
